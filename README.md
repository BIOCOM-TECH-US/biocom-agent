# Biocom Voice Agent (Prototype)

A minimal voice-first agent built with [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/) and OpenAI.  
You can speak to it (push-to-talk) and it answers back using OpenAI STT + TTS.  
Right now it can solve math via the **calculator tool**. Later, weâ€™ll add headset controls.
